# data_collecting_concert_totem

Because I can't just build a "normal" festival totem, I wanted to build something a little different for the summer of 2020.  I wanted the totem to accomplish a few things:

 1. Be fun.
 2. Be something with a bunch of LEDs that I could code some behavior around.
 3. Collect data about the festivals I attend.

# So how does that translate into reality?

The idea is to create a totem that meets festival height requirements, uses an addressable LED matrix to show ambient noise levels, allow the LED matrix to be controlled with a remote (change colors, display messages, re-calibrate, etc), capture data (GPS coordinates, date-time, decibel levels, remote key presses, etc) to an SD card.

Now I have no clue the actual look of the totem, but the running concept is to have a character that encourages people to generate enough noise to get the meter to light up red.
